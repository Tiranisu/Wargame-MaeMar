## About the Company

CyberTrust is a forward-thinking e-commerce platform that provides cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions tailored to meet the needs of both individuals and businesses. Our product offerings include essential tools such as password managers, which help users secure their digital credentials, and firewalls, designed to safeguard networks from potential threats.

Currently, our development team is hard at work creating a new and improved interface for our main website. This update aims to enhance user experience and streamline navigation. However, due to a configuration oversight, the new interfaces have been unintentionally made accessible to the public. Alarmingly, these interfaces are connected to the companyâ€™s primary database, which could pose a potential security risk.
